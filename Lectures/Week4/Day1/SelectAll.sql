/**
 * SQL sublanguage: DQL (Data Query Language)
 *
 * In this lab we are going to learn how to retrieve all the records from a table.
 *
 * The syntax for retrieving all rows and columns from a database table looks like the following:
 * SELECT * FROM table_name;
 *
 * NOTE: the * is a wildcard character to retrieve all the columns from the table.

    /**
     *  Assignment: write the SQL statement in the problem1.sql file to retrieve all the rows and columns from the
     *  table "song". The db table we will utilize for this problem is the "song" table below
     *
     *  Song Table Diagram:
     *  |      title        |        artist         |
     *  ---------------------------------------------
     *  |"Let it be"        |Beatles                |
     *  |"Hotel California" |Eagles                 |
     *  |"Kashmir"          |Led Zeppelin           |
     *
     * Do not change anything in this code. You should write your sql statement on a single line in the
     * problem1.sql file.
